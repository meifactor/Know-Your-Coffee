                    <p>The discovery of coffee in Ethiopia, where legend tells of a goat herder named Kaldi who noticed his goats becoming energetic after eating coffee berries. Monks later used the berries to stay awake during prayers. This serendipitous discovery in the highlands of Ethiopia would eventually spark a global phenomenon, with the region still producing some of the world's most prized coffee varieties today.</p>
